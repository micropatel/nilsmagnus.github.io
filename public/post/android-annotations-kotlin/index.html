  <p>This is a small write-up of my experiences from converting a native android-app from java to kotlin.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TLDR;</h2>
<ol>
<li>Convert the project using android studio</li>
<li>Handle nullability-compilation errors</li>
<li>Android annotations
<ol>
<li>build script</li>
<li>apply lateinit on @ViewById</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Convert your data-objects into small classes, go for immutable classes</li>
<li>Kotlin is cool, and immutability rocks. Bugs in android-studio shows that it is still early days for kotlin-development on android.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="convert-your-project">Convert your project!</h1>
<p>The first step is easy, android-studio will do most of the work for you.
To convert the existing javacode into kotlin, simply <strong>select the src/main/java</strong> folder in the project and choose
<strong>Code-&gt;&quot;Convert Java File to Kotlin File&rdquo;</strong>. Android studio will then try as best as it can
to convert all your java-code to kotlin-code.</p>
<p><img src="/kotlin-convert.png" alt="" title="Convert to kotlin in android-studio"></p>
<p>Android studio will convert all your .java files into .kt files in-place, leaving them in src/main/java.</p>
<p>Your project will probably not compile now, because of differences in how java and kotlin handles nullability.</p>
<h1 id="nullability-issues">nullability(.!!?) issues</h1>
<p>One of the big advantages kotlin has over java is the handling of nullability. By default, an object is non-nullable and has to explicitly specified to be nullable.</p>
<p>In my case, android-studio generated code that would not compile. My data-objects were converted to have nullable-fields, but several kotlin-functions specified non-nullable arguments. To fix this, simply allow nullable-arguments or, even better, make your data-objects immutable with non-nullable fields!</p>
<p><em>error after automatic conversion in android-studio</em> :</p>
<p><img src="/nullability-error1.png" alt="nullability error after conversion" title="error after automatic conversion in android-studio"></p>
<p>The generated nullable field in the class &ldquo;Shipment:&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>class Shipment {
    var shipmentNumber: String? = null
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Simply change this class to an immutable version, by specifying the arguments in a constructor:</p>
<pre><code>class Shipment(val shipmentNumber: kotlin.String, /* other fields goes here */)
</code></pre>
<h1 id="android-annotations-if-applicable">Android-annotations (if applicable)</h1>
<p>When android-studio converted your project, it most likely broke
the usage of your android-annotations usage.</p>
<p>To use android-annotations, add the <em>kotlin-kapt</em> plugin to your build-script and add the android-annotations-dependency to the kapt-configuration:</p>
<pre><code>...
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'
...

dependencies{
...
    kapt &quot;org.androidannotations:androidannotations:4.3.1&quot;

}
</code></pre>
<p>The fields marked with <em>@ViewById</em> will make the annotation-processor complain with the following error:</p>
<pre><code>org.androidannotations.annotations.ViewById cannot be used on a private element
</code></pre>
<p>To resolve this, change the generated code:</p>
<pre><code>@ViewById(R.id.adView)
var adView: AdView? = null
</code></pre>
<p>by adding lateinit and removing the nullability:</p>
<pre><code>@ViewById(R.id.adView)
lateinit var adView: AdView
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>lateinit</strong> keyword in kotlin means that the field can be treated as
non-nullable, but will be initialized after the constructor has been called
(for the purpose of dependency-injection and lazy-initialization).</p>
<p>After removing the nullability-option on the view-fields, the &ldquo;<em>!!</em>&rdquo; notation on references to these fields can be removed.</p>
<h1 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h1>
<p>Even if it is several months since the announcement for kotlin-support on android, the kotlin-plugin
for android studio seems somewhat immature. During my little experience with kotlin in android-studio the plugin
has crashed several times and I had to restart android studio to continue working.</p>
<p><img src="/kotlin-plugin-bugging.png" alt="plugin-crash and restart warning"></p>
<p>I also tried to change the folder-name for my kotlin source-code from <em>src/main/java</em> to <em>src/main/kotlin</em>, but this
caused android studio to stop giving lint-hints and auto-completion even if some of the code was highlighted properly.</p>
<p>These two issues makes me think that kotlin might still be in its early days on android and that more improvements can be done to
improve developer satisfaction.</p>
<p>However, the advantages that kotlin brings with easier-to-read code and immutability
are welcome features that will help avoiding bugs and ease both maintenance and writing of apps for android. A simple(and a bit naive) measure of maintanability is lines of code(LOC), in my case I reduced the LOC by about 33%:</p>
